# Mapping_Earthquakes
Used the Leaflet.js API to populate a geographical map with GeoJSON earthquake data from a URL. Each earthquake will be visually represented by a circle and color, where a higher magnitude will have a larger diameter and will be darker in color. The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.
